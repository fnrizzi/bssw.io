What is a *smart* library?
A critical design goal of a *smart* library is to enable users (who are often developers of applications using the library) to avoid making simple mistakes in building, installing and using the library as well as enabling users to easily diagnose and correct problems when they occur.

Though it is close to twenty years old now, this 2004 NECDC paper lists over 30 concrete software engineering practices useful for developing libraries used in scientific computing still relevant today.

Key differences between Software Quality Engineering (SQE) practices for libraries as opposed to applications are highlighted with explanations of why libraries often have more stringent SQE requirements.

The article ends with a couple of detailed use-cases involving the use of smart libraries in real-world scientific computing workflows and explains how their features ultimately helped to reduce development time and improve productivity.
