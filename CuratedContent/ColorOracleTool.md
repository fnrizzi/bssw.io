The topic of color blindness should be kept in mind while developing software because it directly impacts the accessibility and usability of applications for a significant portion of the population. Approximately 8% of all males are affected by color vision impairment, which is not an insignificant number. Ignoring the needs of this demographic can result in user experiences that are frustrating, confusing, or even completely inaccessible. When designing software, especially applications with visual elements like interfaces or data visualization, developers must consider the potential challenges faced by individuals with common color vision impairments, such as deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.

*[Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/index.html)* enables developers to evaluate their designs as they appear to those with color vision impairments. It functions as a color blindness simulator for various operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. This tool assists designers and developers by applying color filters to their design work, allowing them to see what individuals with different types of color vision impairments experience. By simulating deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia, Color Oracle helps creators ensure that their graphical work is readable not only by those with extreme color blindness but also by individuals with minor color vision deficiencies and those with normal vision.  By using tools such as Color Oracle, developers can ensure that their software is inclusive and can be used effectively by the widest possible audience.
